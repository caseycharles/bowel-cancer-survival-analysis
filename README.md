# bowel-cancer-survival-analysis
Analysis of 5-year colorectal cancer survival by socioeconomic deprivation and gender using NHS England data.
## What I Did 💻  
Using publicly available data from NHS England (2016–2020), I cleaned, filtered, and visualized survival rates across deprivation groups — breaking it down by gender to uncover hidden inequalities. This project helped me sharpen my skills in data wrangling and storytelling through visuals. 🎨📊

## The Data 📂  
- NHS England’s National Cancer Survival Statistics 🇬🇧  
- Focused on colorectal cancer cases only 🦠  
- Survival rates segmented by deprivation quintiles (1 = most deprived, 5 = least deprived) and gender 👩‍🦰👨‍🦰  

## Key Takeaways 💡  
- Survival improves as deprivation decreases — meaning social factors can affect your chances of beating cancer 🎯  
- Women tend to survive slightly better than men across all deprivation levels 👩‍⚕️✨  
- These insights highlight the urgent need for targeted public health strategies to reduce disparities ⚖️❤️  

## What You’ll Find Here 📁  
- A clear, colourful bar chart showing survival differences by deprivation and gender 📊🌈  
- The cleaned Excel dataset I worked with 🗂️  
- The Python notebook/Colab script with all the code, step-by-step 💻🧑🏽‍💻  

## Why You Should Care 💬  
Understanding these disparities is crucial if we want to create fairer health outcomes. Data isn’t just numbers — it tells stories, and this one demands action. 🚀📢
